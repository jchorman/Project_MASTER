<p>We’ve reviewed your project with OIT ISO and Security Team and it is now ready to move to the next step, i.e., for you to complete a Physical System Architecture Review (PSAR) form. This form is available for download at this link: https://tech.nj.gov/it/whatwedo/sar/. When you are ready, please complete and submit your PSAR to the SAR team at: OIT.SARMeeting@tech.nj.gov (copied here).  Please use the attached diagram when submitting the PSAR.</p>

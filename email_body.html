<p>Hello <b>{agency_name} Project Team,</b></p>

<p>It was nice to meet with you and hear about the <b>{project_name}</b> project.</p>

<p>Validated Design is the current SAR checkpoint for your project. This involves a final data and control flow diagram, with all components and communication interfaces defined and labeled with appropriate ports/protocols and control flow initiation (who starts communication). These defined interfaces are then presented to OIT ISO for approval. The final design is also used as the reference point for any operational work that needs to be done, (e.g., firewall rule requests should correspond to it). Completion of Validated Design is a prerequisite for the next SAR (PSAR or Cloud Implementation Review) stage.</p>

<p>Attached is a sample Visio designed to assist with building the data and control flow diagram. Please add/delete components to the Visio diagram to depict your system.</p>

<p>Solutions Architecture is looking forward to assisting your team through the Validated Design phase.</p>

<p>&lt;<b>Below is a summary of related action items mentioned during the LSAR&gt; (if needed)</b></p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>NJOIT Solutions Architecture Team<br>
